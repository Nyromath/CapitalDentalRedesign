          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Dental Checkup/Cavity Assessment</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">On examination, we will check your teeth, and gums and will take x-rays to check the in-between of the teeth for possible decays. From there we will discuss with you your oral health and problems and will advise options for your treatments.<br><br>
            It is important to have your teeth and mouth checked by a dentist at least once a year, but for some patients we recommend six monthly visits as this will be the key in maintaining healthy teeth and gums.<br><br>
            Call the nearest Capital Dental Clinic from you and book a Dental Check-Up appointment.<br>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoDentalHygiene">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Dental Hygiene</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">Dental Hygiene is usually done by a Dental Hygienist but for some of our practices, it is done by a dentist. They will do a thorough periodontal assessment – this involves checking the oral tissues, probing of pocket depths and recession, checking for signs of oral cancers, checking for mobility and assessing your brushing, flossing or special cleaning techniques.<br><br>
            At this point the dental hygienist/dentist will discuss with you about your gum condition, go over recommended home care (with demonstration if need) and then discuss the proposed treatment options.Then, will start scaling with sonic, ultrasonic and hand scalers. Once, tartar is removed then they will polish the teeth with polishing paste to remove residual staining.<br><br>
            Then they will discuss with you about your recall – this is the recommended time you should be coming back to get the hygiene treatment so we can prevent further disease.Regular hygiene treatment will help prevent further inflammation and infection that causes pain to gums.<br><br>
            Book an appointment with one of our lovely hygienists to achieve that squeaky clean smile!<br>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoFissureSealants">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Fissure Sealants</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">The biting surfaces of back teeth are shaped like "hills and valleys' known as cusps and fissures. Toothbrush bristles are unable to get into the narrow fissures to remove plaque and bacteria which produce acid when sugar is eaten, causing decay. To help prevent decay, the fissures are sealed over with a fissure sealant, which is a plastic coating. This means your back teeth (molars) will be less likely to need fillings at a later date.<br><br>
            Placing a fissure sealant is a painless procedure as there is no cutting away of tooth tissue - no drilling.<br>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoNightGuards">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Night Guards/Mouthguards</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">Sports mouth guards are used to prevent damage on the teeth. These are custom made on a model constructed from an impression taken in your mouth. They should fit snugly and therefore will tend to stay in place firmly during sport. They may not be as thick as the expensive pre-made types.<br><br>
            Night guards are recommended to use if you are grinding your teeth or clenching at night. A custom made tray will be made for you to use during asleep.<br>

        </article>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoFillings">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Fillings</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">If you have tooth decay your dentist will remove the damaged enamel/dentine and will replace it with a restorative material.<br><br>
            A “filling” can be any size. Dentists use different surfaces to describe the area of the tooth that requires restoration. You may hear them say you need a “two surface filling”. The size and depth of the restoration will dictate the materials used and the length of the appointment time required. There are many and varied types of “filling” materials now available.We usually use a tooth coloured composite filling material. Also available are Glass Ionomer, or hybrid types of filling materials and we may use these in some situations. Each material has different applications.<br><br>
            (In rare circumstances we may use amalgam as in certain situations it is the best material available, your dentist will discuss this with you.)<br><br>
            With all restorations there may be some sensitivity after completion. It is important to contact your dentist if you experience any on going problems.<br><br>
            Amalgam fillings are also known as “silver fillings” because of their silver-like appearance.<br><br>
            Amalgam fillings contain mercury, and while there is a very low percentage, some people are concerned about mercury leakage. To date no accurate scientific studies have proven that the amount of mercury released by amalgam fillings is harmful.<br><br>
            Amalgam is a strong and durable material that has proven success especially when used in larger cavities. They are less likely to fail than some other types of materials.<br><br>
            Amalgam is also the least expensive type of filling material.<br>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoRootCanals">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Root Canal Treatment</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">Root canal treatment is required when the pulp of the tooth has been damaged. A number of conditions can lead to the irreversible damage of the pulp; decay, deep fillings, trauma, tooth fracture, infection. Sometimes there is no apparent cause. The only option to root canal therapy is the extraction of the tooth.<br><br>
            If you want to know an in depth explanation about Root Canal see this page https://www.dentistwellington.co.nz/clinic/capital-dental-endodontics as we have an Endodontist Dr Dikesh Parmar, a Specialist for  Root Canal working at Capital Dental The Terrace and Capital Dental Lower Hutt.<br>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoDentures">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Dentures</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">Dentures are replacements for missing teeth that can be taken out and put back into your mouth. While dentures take some getting used to, and will never feel exactly the same as one's natural teeth, today's dentures are natural looking and more comfortable than ever. There are two main types of dentures: full and partial.<br><br>
            Come in and speak to a dentist at Capital Dental and they will help you choose the type of denture that's best for you based on whether some or all of your teeth are going to be replaced and the cost involved.<br>

          <p class="servicesParagraph">Many factors, including (but not limited to) beverages such as coffee, tea, soft drink and red wine and certain medications, affect the whiteness of your smile. Teeth whitening is an affordable and effective way to combat common causes of tooth discoloration, while also lifting your self-confidence and improving your appearance.<br><br>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoCrowns">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Crowns</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">A crown is a type of dental restoration which completely caps or encircles a tooth or dental implant. A dental crown can restore the tooth back to its original size, shape, and color. Besides that, a crown surrounds the tooth and makes it strong again, so badly broken or decayed teeth can be strengthened with dental crowns.<br><br>
            A crown can cover up a stained or unusually shaped tooth or close spaces between teeth and correct minor rotations and positions of the teeth. Dental crowns can improve the general appearance, adding to patients self-confidence and giving a nicer smile.<br><br>
            We also offer a One Visit Crown at our Upper Hutt Branch.<br>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoBridges">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Bridges</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">Dental bridges literally bridge the gap created by one or more missing teeth. It is a fixed appliance made up of two or more crowns to replace a missing or extracted tooth, an artificial tooth is directly bonded to an implant or adjacent teeth/tooth.<br></p>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoBotox">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Botox</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">Botox® or Xeomin® are the trade name for Botulinum Toxin, a neurotoxin in the form of a purified protein. The mechanism of action for Botulinum Toxin (Botox or Xeomin) is really quite simple; it is injected into facial muscles but really doesn’t affect the muscle at all. Botulinum Toxin (Botox or Xeomin) works by blocking the transmitters between the motor nerves that innervate the muscle.The areas typically treated with Botulinum Toxin (Botox or Xeomin)   for wrinkles are the forehead, between the eyes (glabellar region), around the corners of the eyes (crow’s feet) and around the lips (smokers lines or gummy smile). There is no loss of sensory feeling in the muscles. Once the motor nerve endings are interrupted, the muscle cannot contract, causing wrinkles in the skin to smooth. The effects of Botulinum Toxin (Botox or Xeomin) last approximately three to four months, at which time the patient will require retreatment.<br><br>
            Botulinum Toxin (Botox or Xeomin) has important clinical uses as an adjunct in facial pain and bruxism cases for patients with chronic TMJ and orofacial pain. Botulinum Toxin (Botox or Xeomin) is also used to complement esthetic dentistry as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery. Book an appointment with Dr Dikesh Parmar to talk more about how this treatment can help you.<br>

        <article class="servicesInfo" id="servicesInfoFastbraces">
          <h1 class="servicesHeading">Fastbraces</h1>
          <p class="servicesParagraph">Fastbraces® were developed to straighten teeth differently. Fastbraces® is the revolutionary system of fast, safe, easy and affordable braces that is changing the field of orthodontics. It is a complete, non-extraction system for most cases, which provides patients with outstanding results.<br><br>
            Why Fastbraces?<br><br>
            Fastbraces will get your teeth straight in a quicker shorter time frame . Quite often from 3-12 months and in a lot of cases as little as 6 months<br><br>
            1. Shorter time having braces on<br>
            2. Often much cheaper than conventional braces<br>
            3. Less Pain<br>
            4. Fix teeth that are chipped or worn down due to wear<br><br>
            Fastbraces are a more conservative and faster way to get your teeth straightened. Often no extractions are involved and the system is involved in correcting the eruption problems that your teeth have experienced when they have developed.<br><br>

          <h1 class="endoHeading">Dr Dikesh Parmar - Endodontist</h1>
          <h4 class="endoSubHeading">Founder of the Capital Dental branches</h4><br>
          <p class="aboutPara">I was born in Suva, Fiji and migrated to New Zealand when I was 16. I completed high school education at St. Patrick's College, Kilbirnie, Wellington and attended University of Otago where I graduated with Bachelor of Dental Surgery in 2000. I spent four years in Wellington working in private dental practices. During this time I also established the Capital Dental group of practices in Wellington.</p><br>
          <p class="aboutPara">Whilst working in general dentistry I realised that I was passionate about endodontic procedures and therefore needed to up skill myself. I undertook a full time 3 year endodontic programme at University of Otago and graduated with a Clinical Doctorate in Endodontics in 2007 and am now a registered Endodontic Specialist.</p><br>
          <p class="aboutPara">I look forward to meeting you and being able to assess and treat your Root Canal problems.</p>
